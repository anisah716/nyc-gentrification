# New York City Gentrification 

This project is to understand the  effects  gentrification has on crime rates throughout New York City on. Over the recent years New York City has experienced a huge influx of gentrification. Specifically, in areas throughout Brooklyn and Queens.  . I was able to pull a large database of every shooting in and arrests in NYC from nyc.go. This data ranges from 2006 to 2018, the range was perfect to picture the growth of the effects in these areas.
