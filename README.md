# nyc-gentrification
This project is to understand the  effects  gentrification has on crime rates throughout New York City on. Over the recent years New York City has experienced a huge influx of gentrification. Specifically, in areas throughout Brooklyn and Queens.  . I was able to pull a large database of every shooting in and arrests in NYC from nyc.go. This data ranges from 2006 to 2018, the range was perfect to picture the growth of the effects in these areas. 

Breaking down the data: 
To break down the data I had to filter out a lot of information and clean it into what's relevant and what isn't. Now to sorting through the data, there were two datasets we were observing. One was arresting the other one was shootings. The arrests were the largest file to filter through with 4,798,339 reported arrests. The data is provided directly from the NYPD.  I started filtering there using both Queens and Brooklyn as a filter.   I focused on burglary, dangerous drugs and murders. 

The second data set was shootings this was every reported shooting in NYC. This included both fatal and non-fatal shootings. This dataset was a lot easier to sort through because it just had to be sorted through the borough it was reported in. Based off of that I was able to make visualization and count the number of shootings in Brooklyn and Queens between 2006 and 2018.  

The Process: 
The process to use our data to provide our results. With the arrests Filtering with the type of Offense and the year I performed a count and using Matplotlib I was able to plot the information into both a pie chart and a line graph. To understand both the percentages and also to be able to visualize a trend with the information. Sorting the shootings , I just used the borough and the year to perform a groupby. Using that I was able to perform a count and graph a pie chart and bar graph based off of that. 




Opportunities and Limitations:
Future opportunities for this project would be exploring other aspects of gentrification within the city. For example, an increase in restaurants and types of restaurants in the area. As well as facilities like gyms and grocery stores that open up in the area throughout the years. Some limitations from the data were the inability to focus in on certain parts of Brooklyn and Queens. Not all of Brooklyn and Queens are gentrified yet parts like Williamsburg, Long Island City, and Astoria experience higher velocities of gentrification as opposed to Corona and Sheepshead Bay. The precinct and the longitude and latitude were provided. With more time this type of visualizations would be possible.
